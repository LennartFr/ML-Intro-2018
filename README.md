# Machine Learning at IBM

[Open Source Machine Learning technologies at IBM:](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/machine-learning)
Use the same Jupyter notebooks you know and love, with Python, R, and Scala. Jump-start your R experience with a free, open-source RStudio tool. Scale on demand with Apache Spark and create while you learn.
